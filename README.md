# anope-modules
Third Party modules for Anope that I've created.  
The proper place to view and download these modules is on the [Anope IRC Services Modules Site](https://modules.anope.org/index.php?page=home).  
I'll give a short summary of each module here anyways.

### cs_set_joinflood
A less restrictive join flood protection, a flood of unregistered users will lock the
channel to registered users only. It will do this either with a channel mode (if available)
or via temporary kick-bans.

### m_expirenotice
To send a notice (via email and/or memo) to a user that their registered nickname or
channel is soon to expire and/or expired. Fully configurable with what to send for and
how to send the notices, when to send the pre-expiry notices, and the messages sent.

### os_expiring
A simple Services Oper command to list out soon to expire nicknames or channels.
